# retropie-rom-uploader

## What is this project?
Some small scripts that upload files from your local machine to a Raspberry Pi via SFTP.

The intention of this project is to create an easy way to upload ROMs from your local machine
to your Raspberry Pi for use on [Retropie](https://retropie.org.uk/docs/). This is done by connecting
to the Raspberry Pi through SSH and uploading files via SFTP.

These scripts take ROMs and place them in the correct folder on the Raspberry Pi such that Retropie
picks them up and categorizes them to the correct console.
